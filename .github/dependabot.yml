# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://help.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates

version: 2

    # by default Dependabot creates labels like "major" or "minor" for version updates of our deps.
    # however this interferes with the github changelog generator which uses these labels to define
    # a new version for the collection
