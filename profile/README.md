# Challenge

Running secure infrastructure is a difficult task.
Although server hardening is a well-known topic with many guides out in the wild, it is still very cumbersome to apply and verify secure configuration.
If you manage many server, they need to be configured properly and maintained, which is difficult and time-consuming to get right.
To answer these needs for security, compliance, and maintainability, we decided to launch this project as a common ground for requirements and their fulfillment.

# Vision / Goal

Our goal is simple: Create a common layer for operating system and services hardening.
Even if you arenâ€™t knee-deep in configuration manuals for services or the latest security recommendations, you will be able to implement and use this framework with ease.
